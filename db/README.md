OK, the base database is mxm_dataset.db, but in the Python code it’s called SongPop.db.
This database has two tables: lyrics and words.
The python files each add another table to the database.
First, add_metadata.py - it adds a table called songs, copied directly from track_metadata.db
Add_chords.py - it adds a table called chords, copied from chordonomicon_v2.csv
Add_ratings.py - it adds a table called ratings, copied from song_ratings_data.csv
Add_spotify.py - it adds a table called spotify, copied from Music Info.csv

Run each of these files in order, and you’ve got the complete database!
Important: make sure to change the file paths in the code before running any of these!

The main table is songs. The chords and ratings tables connect to songs through the spotify table, which contains the exact same title used in the ratings table, and the spotify id used in the chords table.
The lyrics table connects directly to the songs table via the same Million Song Dataset ID.
Using a big join, it should be possible to create a table with all the relevant info.
I would prioritize songs which have ratings, then lyrics, then chords.
